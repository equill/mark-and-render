README for mark-and-render

Basic package for parsing and rendering wiki-style markup into HTML.
Designed to be extensible via render macros. The emphasis is on *basic* and scope is restricted to parsing-and-rendering for markup to HTML.

The internal protocol is nice and simple: the parser turns its input into the kind of AST as one would find from READing an s-expression, and the renderer takes that AST and turns it into HTML.
It would be entirely feasible to replace the default renderer, though I've currently installed no explicit mechanism to make said replacement any simpler than editing the .asd file.

Two styles of markup:
- wikimarkup, at least one variety thereof
- s-expressions

Two symbols are exported:
- render-content (from mar.lisp)
- escape-string (from renderer-default.lisp)
The parsers don't export anything, and never should.

render-content takes a string, expecting either s-expressions or wikimarkup, and returns a string containing the resulting HTML.

escape-string takes a string and replaces characters of concern with the equivalent HTML entities.

For examples, read (the very short and rudimentary) test.lisp.

There's a basic example of the available extensibility in the form of the :link function in the renderer, but a more generally useful means of inserting macro tags is next in the pipeline.

Bugs are tracked via BugsEverywhere (http://www.bugseverywhere.org/), to keep it in sync with the state of whatever version you happen to be working with.
